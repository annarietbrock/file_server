    <h2>Rules</h2>

    The game of P, R, S is based on trust, skill and determination.
    With each round, each player must choose whether to play:
    <ul>
      <li>Rock</li>
      <li>Paper</li>
      <li>Scissors</li>
    </ul>

    The winner of each round is determined by which player throws the "strongest" object.
    The strength of each object is as follows:

    <ul>
      <li>Rock beats Scissors</li>
      <li>Paper beats Rock</li>
      <li>Scissors beats Paper</li>
      <br>
    </ul>

    If both players throw the same object, neither player gets a point.
